Blues-Jazz (Jazz-Blues?) Improv Practice Tool

This is a 12-bar oriented practice tool. That is, it's made to play groups of 12 bars, in the standard ("simple") `I7 I7 I7 I7 / IV7 IV7 I7 I7 / V7 V7 I7 I7` progression. So 24 or 36, etc. measures make more sense than any other multiple. However, Jazz is freeform by nature. So YMMV.
